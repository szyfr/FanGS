## Fantasy Grande Strategy
### Language: Odin

A grand strategy game inspired by Europa Universalis 4 and its extremely popular fantasy total conversion mod Anbennar using Odin and Raylib.

The world of grand strategy games is full of historical games with a varied amount fatastical elements, from just simple political "what if"s as with Hearts of Iron 4, the creation of cultures or religions that have no basis in reality with Crusader Kings 3, or Aztec invasions of europe and/or the killing of Cthulhu with Crusader Kings 2.

FanGS (**Fan**tasy **G**rand **S**trategy) is designed from the ground up to be more generalized in the time period it takes place in, instead it's all about telling more fantasical stories in different world from our own.

As the game is currently being built from the ground up, work on a custom world for the game has yet to be started. Instead, however, the EU4 mod Anbennar is being used as it forms a good baseline for what I want to do with this game as a whole.

Name is not final, and subject to change when either I come up with something better, or someone else gives me it.
